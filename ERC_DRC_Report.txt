ERC/DRC initial report (placeholder)
- No PCB loaded yet: generate footprints and place modules, then run ERC/DRC in KiCad.
- Expected checks to run:
  * Floating power nets
  * Unconnected pins
  * Annular ring violations (min 0.15 mm)
  * Clearance violations (min per netclass)
  * DQ/DQS diffpair tuning rules
- After first placement and routing an actual DRC log will be generated and stored here.
