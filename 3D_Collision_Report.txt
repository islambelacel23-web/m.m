3D collision initial report (placeholder)
- Using generic STEP placeholders for connectors.
- Missing STEP files that would improve collision checking:
  * Quectel_RM502Q STEP
  * NVMe socket STEP
  * SFP+ cage STEP (if not provided in repo)
  * RJ45 MagJack STEP
- Once STEP files are available, import them in KiCad 3D viewer and rerun collision checks; record collisions here.
